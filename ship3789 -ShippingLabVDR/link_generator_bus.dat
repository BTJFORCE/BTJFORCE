## Purpose: Create links for variables that are not message variables.
##          Links to/from message variables are found in ncs_dmi_com.lod
## 
## Contains links for: Generator bus configurations (up to 6 engines)
##
## Additional engine links necessary when several engines are linked on
## one generator bus device (math model 802). Note that engine no. 1 is dealt
## with in standard link files (azi prop or voith schneider prop).
